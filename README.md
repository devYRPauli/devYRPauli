## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a curious engineer, problem solver, and lifelong learner from Kanpur, India — now turning ideas into impact at the University of Florida.

From designing scalable backend systems and optimizing algorithms to building accessible platforms that serve thousands, I thrive on solving real-world problems through tech.

Whether it's revamping architectures with Docker, boosting performance with dynamic programming, or crafting event portals that engage 50K+ students — I'm all about thoughtful engineering with measurable results.

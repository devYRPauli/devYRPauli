## About Me

```yaml
Location: Gainesville, Florida, United States
Origin: Kanpur, India
Education: 
  - M.S. Computer & Information Science & Engineering, University of Florida (GPA: 3.8/4.0)
  - B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering, Jaypee University (GPA: 9.1/10.0)

Current Role: Software Engineer @ UF Institute of Food & Agricultural Sciences

Philosophy: "Do it scared. Do it imperfect. Just do it." — Progress over perfection.
```

I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer who builds production platforms across scientific research, legal tech, and real-time collaboration systems. My work spans genomics data management (LIMS serving 30+ researchers with 150K+ records), mobile applications connecting users with legal professionals, and scalable cloud infrastructure.

**What drives my work:**
- Understanding the real problem before writing code
- Building the simplest solution that actually works
- Measuring impact through concrete metrics
- Iterating based on user feedback

## Current Work

**Software Engineer | UF Institute of Food & Agricultural Sciences**

Building a production Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) from the ground up. What started as replacing messy spreadsheet workflows is now the primary system for all lab data submissions across 5 labs.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript with specialized genome visualization (IGV.js, JBrowse) and analytics dashboards (Plotly, Nivo)
- **Backend:** Django REST API managing 150K+ records across 20+ interconnected data models with unified search and complex relational queries
- **Integrations:** BLAST, MAFFT, InterPro for bioinformatics workflows
- **Automation:** R Markdown pipeline reducing manual processing from 2-3 hours to 15-20 minutes
- **Infrastructure:** Deployed on GCP with Kubernetes, Terraform IaC, Docker multi-stage builds, JWT authentication, CI/CD pipelines

**Impact:**
- Serves 30+ researchers across 5 labs
- Replaced manual spreadsheet workflows
- Became the primary system for all lab data submissions
- Enabled quarterly releases (previously semi-annual)
- Increased daily active users by 40% through performance optimization (8s to 3s page loads)

The best part? We went from shipping updates twice a year to every quarter.

## Featured Projects

### SynapseFlow — Real-Time Collaborative Analytics Platform

Real-time collaboration platform with sub-second query latency supporting 100+ concurrent users. Think Google Docs, but for data analysis.

**Stack:** React, TypeScript, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, WebSockets, Kafka, Kubernetes, GCP

**Key Features:**
- Optimistic UI updates and conflict resolution for simultaneous editing
- Event-driven architecture with intelligent caching
- Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes for traffic spikes
- Consistent sub-second response times under load

---

### CodePilot AI — Developer Productivity Assistant

AI assistant using RAG architecture to analyze codebases and answer developer questions. It's like having a senior engineer who's read your entire codebase.

**Stack:** React, TypeScript, Python, FastAPI, OpenAI API, FAISS, Pinecone, GitHub Webhooks, GCP

**Key Features:**
- GitHub webhook integration for automated PR issue detection
- Code health dashboard with refactoring suggestions
- Semantic search across 10K+ files in under 500ms using FAISS
- Historical pattern analysis for proactive code quality insights

---

### Legal Tech Mobile Application (Hackdev Technology)

Flutter mobile app connecting scam victims across India with legal professionals. The challenge? Figuring out how to ask the right questions to understand someone's problem and route them to the right lawyer automatically.

**Stack:** Flutter, Dart, Firebase Realtime Database, Redis, Docker, GitHub Actions

**Technical Implementation:**
- Intelligent intake system with conditional questioning logic to classify issues
- Automated case assignment matching users with specialized lawyers
- Real-time synchronization optimized from 4-5 seconds to under 2 seconds
- Comprehensive testing reducing crash rate from 8% to under 2%
- CI/CD pipeline reducing deployment time from 2+ hours to 15 minutes

## Currently Exploring

I'm always learning and building. Right now I'm diving into:
- Advanced RAG architectures and vector databases for intelligent code analysis
- Kubernetes orchestration patterns and cloud-native infrastructure optimization
- Real-time data synchronization strategies for collaborative systems at scale
- Scientific data visualization techniques for complex genomics datasets
- AI-powered automation for reducing manual workflows in research environments

## A Bit About My Approach

I focus on understanding the actual problem first. Not just what someone says they need, but what will actually help them. Then I build the simplest solution that works, measure the impact, and iterate from there.

Some examples of this in action:
- **Automated a 2-3 hour manual report process down to 15-20 minutes** using R and OpenAI API
- **Fixed page loads that were taking 8 seconds** (researchers were giving up) - got them down to 3 seconds through code splitting and lazy loading
- **Optimized Firebase sync from 4-5 seconds to under 2 seconds** when multiple people were submitting cases at once
- **Built CI/CD pipelines** so teams could deploy independently instead of waiting on IT or senior engineers

## Beyond the Code

**Gaming:** Tactical FPS enthusiast but will lose hours in a story-rich RPG  
**Music:** Lo-fi for flow state, Desi Hip-Hop for hustle mode  
**Photography:** Aesthetic reels, golden hour skies, minimal desk setups  
**Mindset:** "Do it scared. Do it imperfect. Just do it." — Progress over perfection.

## Let's Connect

**Open to Full-Stack, Backend, and Platform Engineering roles**

I'm interested in positions where I can architect production systems that solve real problems for real users.
